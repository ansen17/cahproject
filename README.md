Determining Contact Angle Hysteresis on Sinusoidal Patterned Surfaces
==============

Summary of the Project
--------------

**Background of Wetting **

	Wetting describes a fluid's ability to remain contact with a surface and contact angle and its hysteresis are the most common quantitative measures to illustrate this phenomenon. Contact angle hysteresis is defined as the receding contact angle subtracted from the advancing contact angle. 

*Specifics of Project*

- Obtained a set of commands to determine appropriate evolution algorithm
- Create commands that will use the energy and interface functions to obtain physical data measurements
- Display a phase diagram through dataset in multiple arrays.

    Add a indent and this will end up as code
